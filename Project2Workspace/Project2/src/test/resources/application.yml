#      ddl-auto: create

# Handy notes below
#      hbm2ddl.auto is a hibernate mapping to your ddl-schema.
#      
#      What are settings for hbm2ddl.auto?
#      
#      CREATE
#      drops all existing tables (and other entities) with names you have provided in annotations
#      then hibernate will create your schema from scratch.
#      (THIS IS NOT PARTICULARLY GREAT FOR PRODUCTION!!! THIS is used for Dev purposes)
#      
#      VALIDATE
#      hibernate checks to make sure the schema exists as expected before operating
#      
#      UPDATE
#      hibernate will NOT delete anything, it'll only add/modify existing schema elements, so that
#      the schema works with hibernate's schema
#      
#      CREATE-DROP
#      hibernate will create your schema then delete it when the application ends
#      
#      NONE
#      well...it means hibernate won't do anything to your schema automatically
