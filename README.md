# Revature Social Network (Enterprise)

## Project Description

In this social network, everyone is friends with everyone. As a user, you will be able to register and login to your account. When you successfully login, you are automatically friends with everyone which means you will see a feed of everyone's posts. Users will be able to create a post and like other people's posts. Users will also have the ability to view other profiles which will display posts of that specific user.
